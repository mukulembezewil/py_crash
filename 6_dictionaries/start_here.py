# A Python dictionary is a data structure that stores a collection of Key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. Dictionaries are created using curly braces and can be defined as objects with the data type 'dict'. They are ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are commonly used to store and retrieve data based on a unique key.
