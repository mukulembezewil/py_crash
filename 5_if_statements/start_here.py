# IF STATEMENTS

# Pythonâ€™s if statement allows you to examine the current STATE of a program and respond apprOpriately to that STATE.

cars = ["audi", "bmw", "subaru", "toyota"]

for car in cars:
    if car == "bmw":
        print(car.upper())
    else:
        print(car.title())

	# CONDITIONAL TESTS

# At the heart of every if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as True or False and is called a conditional test.

	# Checking for Equality ==

		#The simplest conditional test checks whether the value of a variable is equal to the value of interest:

car = "bmw"
print(car == "bmw")	# True

	# Case Sensitive

# Testing for equality is case sensitive in Python.

car = "Audi"
print(car == "audi")	# False

# if case doesnâ€™t matter and instead you just want to test the value of a variable, you can convert the variableâ€™s value to lowercase before doing the comparison:

car = "toyota"
print(car.lower() == "toyota")	# True
# Returns True because the test is now case insensitive
print(car)
# Note that the value stored in car has not been affected by the lower() method.

	# Checking for InEquality !=

requested_topping = "mushrooms"

if requested_topping != "anchovies":
    print("Please take back your anchovies!")

# Numerical Comparisons

age = 18
print(age == 18)	# True

print(age_1 >=21 and age_2 >=21)	# False
print(age_1 >= 18 and age_2 >= 18)	# True

print(age_1 > 18 or age_2 == 16)	# True
print(age_1 < 20 or age_2 > 60)	# False 
# An or expression fails only when both individual tests fail.

# To improve readability, you can use parentheses around the individual tests, but they are not required: 
age_2 = 24

if (age_1 >= 21) and (age_2 >= 21):
    print("Yep, this' true.")

	# BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS

# Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional test. 
# A Boolean value is either True or False. Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions e.g.

print('\n-----Cinema Entrance fee-----\n')

    price = 0

# In the above you could use the else block in place of the last elif block.
	# else:
		# price = 20
		# design = "a Senior citizen"
# Python does not require an else block at the end of an if-elif chain. Sometimes, an else block is useful. Other times, itâ€™s clearer to use an additional elif statement that catches the specific condition of interest.
# The final elif block assigns a price of $20 when the person is 65 or older, which is a little clearer than the general else block. With this, every block of code must pass a specific test in order to be executed. 
# The else block is a catchall statement. It matches any condition that wasnâ€™t matched by a specific if or elif test, and that can sometimes include invalid or even malicious data. 
# If you have a specific final condition youâ€™re testing for, consider using a final elif block and omit the else block. As a result, youâ€™ll be more confident that your code will run only under the correct conditions.


		# Testing Multiple Conditions

# If you want only one block of code to run, use an if-elif-else chain. If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of indepen- dent if statements.
