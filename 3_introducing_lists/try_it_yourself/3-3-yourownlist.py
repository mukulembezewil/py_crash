# Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

means = ["private jet", "mercedes benz", "citation x", "motor bike", "speed boat", "drone flight"]

print(f"My {means[2].title()} {means[0]} is airborne at 22:00Hrs on Friday.")

print(f"This {means[1].title()} 2024 model is pretty sleek and fast.")

print(f"We'll take the new {means[4]} for a test ride tomorrow.")

print(f"Have you tested that {means[-1]} yet?")
